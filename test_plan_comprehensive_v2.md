- [ ] Security audit log analysis

### 📊 TEST METRICS TARGETS
- **Test Coverage**: >95% of all components
- **Success Rate**: >98% of tests passing
- **Performance**: Within established benchmarks
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

### 🚀 EXECUTION APPROACH
1. Execute tests in logical dependency order
2. Document all findings and issues
3. Implement fixes for any discovered problems
4. Re-test after fixes
5. Generate comprehensive test report

### 📋 CURRENT STATUS
- **Tests Completed**: 5/14 major test categories
- **Issues Found**: 2 (High CPU load, Memory parsing bug)
- **Next Priority**: Fix memory monitoring, then Dask cluster validation
