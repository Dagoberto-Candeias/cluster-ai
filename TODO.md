# Cluster AI - Technical Review and Improvements TODO

## High Impact (Security, Core Functionality, Maintenance)

### 1. Security Audit and Hardening
- [ ] Audit all scripts for dangerous commands (rm -rf, sudo, etc.) - FOUND: backup_manager.sh, cleanup_manager.sh (safe usage)
- [ ] Implement credential management for API keys, tokens
- [ ] Add integrity checks for downloaded models
- [ ] Enhance logging and auditing for critical operations

### 2. Script Consolidation and Standardization
- [ ] Merge update_checker.sh and update_notifier.sh into unified update_manager.sh
- [ ] Consolidate Ollama model scripts (auto_download_models.sh + install_additional_models.sh)
- [ ] Standardize all script headers per ShellCheck standards
- [ ] Add robust input validation and error handling to all scripts
- [ ] Enhance cleanup/backup script safety with additional checks

### 3. Ollama Workers and Models Completion
- [x] Complete model_manager.sh with full functionality (list, cleanup, optimize)
- [ ] Add load balancing and failover for Ollama workers
- [ ] Implement model rollback and version management
- [ ] Add integrity validation for model downloads

## Medium Impact (Documentation, Testing)

### 4. Documentation Consolidation
- [ ] Merge all README variants into central README.md
- [ ] Add comprehensive environment variables documentation
- [ ] Document all scripts, workflows, and Ollama management
- [ ] Add system requirements and dependencies section

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add CI integration with .gitlab-ci.yml
- [ ] Create integration tests for Ollama workers
- [ ] Add automated linting (ShellCheck, flake8)

## Low Impact (Optimization, Configuration)

### 6. Configuration Optimization
- [ ] Add rollback automation to docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Disable telemetry in .vscode/settings.json
- [ ] Optimize VSCode settings for better performance
- [ ] Add deploy/rollback scripts for production

## Followup and Validation
- [ ] Run ShellCheck on all modified scripts
- [ ] Execute consolidated scripts to verify functionality
- [ ] Run test suite with coverage reporting
- [ ] Test Ollama model management flows
- [ ] Validate security improvements
